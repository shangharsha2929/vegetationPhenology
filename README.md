# vegetationPhenology
This code extracts mean DN values over defined region of interest, use those mean DN values to
compute mean GCC, and RCC values over all images. Finally, from these values, daily average of
VIs are computed and both saved as well as plotted. 
Note: Assign the image path in 'thePath' variable. Before running the code, make sure all snow
covered images are moved to the folder named 'SnowImage' in the same path with the rest of images.
